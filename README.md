## About

**Octogriffin** acts as a bridge between your GitHub workflow and your Habitica RPG character. Instead of manually checking off "Did code today" tasks, this application listens to GitHub webhooks and automatically rewards you based on the complexity and impact of your work.

It is built with **Next.js**, **Prisma**, and **PostgreSQL**.

## Features

- **Automated Rewards**:
  - **Push Commits**: Earn XP for every commit (with configurable anti-spam caps).
  - **Pull Requests**: Get a large XP boost for opening and merging PRs.
  - **Code Reviews**: Incentivize team collaboration by rewarding code reviews.
- **Bank-Grade Security**:
  - **AES-256 Encryption**: User API tokens are encrypted at rest.
  - **Webhook Verification**: Strictly verifies GitHub SHA-256 signatures to prevent spoofing.
- **Configurable**: Define your own difficulty multipliers (e.g., "Hard Mode" for legacy repos).
- **Open Source**: Licensed under AGPLv3.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js 16](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Neon or Docker)
- **ORM**: [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js / GitHub OAuth
- **Deployment**: Vercel
